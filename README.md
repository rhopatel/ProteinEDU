ProteinEDU

An interactive protein-folding educational game that teaches the user the basics of primary structure amino acid interactions.

Inspiration for this project was taken primarily from Foldit, a similarly styled game that involves folding proteins, which actually crowdsources the "work" of determining the structure of real proteins by presenting them to the user in the form of puzzles to solve. The results can then actually be directly used by scientists to determine the correct folding conformation of these proteins, making a real world impact by helping them create models used to develop new medicines to treat disease. Another program called EteRNA, developed right here at Carnegie Mellon, is another "game with a purpose" that enlists the user to help discover the optimal folding of RNA molecules. 

My own game is meant to be purely educational, with the "proteins" being modeled solely at the lowest level of biological complexity, the primary structure (like beads on a string). It uses the same puzzle styled approach as the previous two, but instead of collecting data for the good of science, the idea is to teach anyone (regardless of background biology knowledge) how different amino acids interact with one another, because those basic interactions (hydrogen bonds, disulfide bridge, et. cetera) are what govern the folding of all proteins in every living being on earth. The project is also similar to PyMOL, a software (developed partly in Python) designed to allow users to visualize high-level structures of complicated proteins. However, this software is tailored primarily towards those with a fair deal of experience in biology, as it is difficult to use otherwise. Hence, my game is a combination of both of these types, aiming to teach anyone at all who plays the game the basics of protein folding, all the while never once touching a textbook.
