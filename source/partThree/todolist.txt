Issues:

Graphics text glitching out when objects moved 
Amino acids get stuck sometimes after being moved ✓
Occasional crash due to some string issue (misread??)
Amino acid chemical picture glitching out ✓




Done list:


1) fix h-bond, electrostatic, and disulfide bridge drawing
  - h bonds and electrostatic are not drawn, also consult textbook
	- draw dotted lines

1a) fix the "no attribute" error 

Do list:

2) Build a working UI that incorporates the current command line help (converting all print statements to into the interface)
  - help screen (possibly with images from textbook)
  - info screen
  - formatted everything properly (change magic numbers and values)

3) Configure path to work with Mac

4) Autosolve feature
 - design and implement

5) Fix all graphical glitches
  - text and lines glitching
  
6) Dashed lines



Limitations (for simplicities' sake):

Only primary structure (in 2D) is shown
Interactions between real and partial charges (dipole-ion) are not taken into account
Interactions between sidechains and backbones are ignored
Amino Acids are represented only as circles
To determine amino acid "satisfaction", both location and interaction are considered (in other words, a polar AA has only to hbond OR be at the edge to be satisfied)
