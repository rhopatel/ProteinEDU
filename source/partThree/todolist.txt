Issues:

Graphics text glitching out when objects moved 
Amino acids get stuck sometimes after being moved ✓
Occasional crash due to some string issue (misread??)
Amino acid chemical picture glitching out ✓



Build list:


1) fix h-bond, electrostatic, and disulfide bridge drawing
  - h bonds and electrostatic are not drawn, also consult textbook
	- draw dotted lines

1a) fix the "no attribute" error

2) Build a working UI that incorporates the current command line help (converting all print statements to into the interface)
  - help screen (possibly with images from textbook)
  - info screen
  - formatted everything properly

3) Autosolve feature
 - design and implement

4) Fix all graphical glitches
  - text and lines glitching
  


Limitations (for simplicities' sake):

Only primary structure (in 2D) is shown
Interactions between real and partial charges (dipole-ion) are not taken into account
Interactions between sidechains and backbones are ignored
To determine amino acid "satisfaction", both location and interaction are considered (in other words, a polar AA has only to hbond OR be at the edge to be satisfied)
